You asked for it now here it is. Pump it up PRIME theme for CMSMA formerly called ‘CMPRIME’. Because it was made by me *(duh)*.

***Note:*** *In order to install this theme you’ll need to have my build previously installed.*

[cesarmades’ StepMania AMX fork](https://mega.nz/?fbclid=IwAR18xWeOVzfLtziqPxll16H5H6Lubb4s7qwiC5zDFBGvVyGLCJZuy2C1wzU#!1sBTAQiY!WDjwH2jhMWsH28Ankg8UNVKZYd-Dk4qACtgfy81lAkk)

The theme may be updated on the same platform, but since I’m not really interested on keep releasing stuff for CMSMA I wouldn’t care to sync that repo. If an update happens I will inform you all via this page or my website.

## Instructions for dummies.

1. Download the theme from the link provided.
2. Download the CMSMA build from the link provided and install it.
3. Locate the installation folder of CMSMA.
4. Grab the zip generated by GitHub and extract its contents inside the ‘Themes’ folder.
5. Add your songs. You can use the tool below to convert your existing StepF2/StepP1 setup to SMA format.
